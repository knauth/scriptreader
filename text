Abigail: Uncle? He looks to her. Susanna Walcott’s here from Doctor Griggs.
Parris: Oh?. Let her come, let her come.
Abigail, leaning out the door to call to Susanna, who is down the hall a few
steps: Come in, Susanna.
Susanna Walcott, a little younger than Abigail, a nervous, hur-ried girl, enters.
Parris, eagerly: What does the doctor say, child?
Susanna, craning around Parris to get a look at Betty: He bid me come and tell
you, reverend sir, that he cannot discover no medicine for it in his books.
Parris: Then he must search on.
Susanna: Aye, sir, he have been searchin’ his books since he left you, sir. But he
bid me tell you, that you might look to un-natural things for the cause of it.
